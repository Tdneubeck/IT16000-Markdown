The Basenji dog is a unique breed that has been native to Africa for a long time. these dogs are small to medium size but are used in hunting. these dogs are not able to bark but have a howl instead. They are quick and self-groom themselves like cats.

American Kennel Club States:
> A Basenji should never run loose, as the breed's instinct to hunt is very strong, and the dog might not be able to resist the urge to run off on a chase.
