This is the first mixed dog that has been popular. A Cavoodle is a cross between a King Charles Cavalier and a poodle. They are small energetic and vocal dogs that do not shed as much as a normal dog which makes them popular for households. they are incredibly friendly and affectionate. They love to be around people and are happiest when they're with their owners. Their sweet nature makes them a great choice for households with children, as they are patient and gentle with kids of all ages.
